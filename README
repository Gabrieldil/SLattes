This project is about the construction of tools to process and
transform XML Brazilian Curriculum Lattes files [1] to RDF data
[2]. So that, the purpose of this project is to bridging the gap
between the Brazilian Curriculum Lattes plataform and semantic web
technologies.

Status:
=======

We have just started the project and we hope to have
contributions. Our first priority will be publications followed by
academic activites and personal information.


Usage:
======

$ xsltproc lattes.xsl CURRICULUM.xml > CURRICULUM.rdf 

Reasoning:
==========

We can use the CWM [1] tool to reasoning over the RDF produced. For
example, to identify duplicated authors.

cwm --rdf lixo1.rdf --n3 duplicated-authors.n3 --think --data --rdf > lixo2.rdf
