The purpose of this project is to bridging the gap between the
Brazilian Curriculum Lattes plataform and semantic web
technologies. We developed a XSLT stylesheet that process XML
Brazilian Curriculum Lattes files [1] generating RDF data [2]. We have
also developed a updated DTD specification for the Lattes XML. The
CNPq DTD specification is not uptated since 2003/2004.


Status
======

We have just started the project and we hope to have
contributions. Our first priority will be publications followed by
academic activites and personal information.


XSLT's usage
============

$ xsltproc --stringparam ID LATTESID lattes.xsl CURRICULIUM.xml > CURRICULIUM.rdf

DTD usage
=========

We supply a simple python script. Moreover, in *Nix systems you can run:

$ xmllint --dtdvalid LMPLCurriculo.DTD --noout <LATTES-XML>
